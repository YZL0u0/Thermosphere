<h1>Aurora</h1>
<p>Aurora is a product of reaction between charged particles from the sun and the gases in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In this situation, sun expels solar wind which carries charged particles.<br>
Our Earth's magnetic field acts as a shield and deflects most of the charged particles in the solar wind. <br>
However, some of the charged particles do not get deflected, but flow along the magnetic field towards the poles where they will enter the atmosphere and collide with oxygen as well as nitrogen.<br>
The collision emits various colours into the atmosphere causing the occurance of auroras. <br>
For instance, collision between charged particles and oxygen make green and red, whereas collision between charged particles and nitrogen make blue and purple. <br></p>

<h1>Ionosphere</h1>
<p>Thermosphere is also called 'Ionosphere' because it contains ions that can reflect radio waves.</p><br>
<h1>What is an ion?</h1>
<p>Ion is an atom with a positive or negative charge.</p>
<p>Ions are formed due to the gain or loss of electrons.<img src="electron.png" alt="electron" style="width:90px;height:50px;"><img src="proton.png" alt="proton" style="width:130px;height:50px;"><br>
Protons will not be gained or lost. </p>
<p>Positive ion is known as 'cation'.<br>
It is formed when an atom losses electrons causing the number of protons (positive) is greater than the number of electrons (negative).<br>
For example, Na+ (sodium losses one electron) and Mg+2 (magnesium losses two electrons).</p>

<p>Negative ion is called 'anion'.<br>
It is formed when an atom gains electrons causing the number of electrons (negative) is greater than the number of protons (positive).<br>
For example, Cl- / Chloride (chlorine gains 1 electron) and O-2 / Oxide (chlorine gains 2 electrons).</p>

<h1>How are ions formed in the ionosphere?</h1>
<p>The solar radiation ionizes.<br> This is a process of removing the electrons from the gas atoms and molecules in the atmosphere.</p><br>
<h1>How can radio waves get reflected in the ionosphere?</h1>
<p>When the radio waves hit the free electrons in the ionosphere, they will vibrate and the energy will be reemitted back down to the earth at the same frequency.</p>
